I have developed a two-player chess game, designed and implemented in Python using the Pygame library.
The game features basic chess functionalities, allowing two players to compete on a single PC with visual and interactive elements to facilitate the gameplay.
Kindly have a look at the .mkv file for a demo.

For the code itself, it has been segmented into two files: compil and functions, and you would need both to run the game. 
Kindly change the path of the files according to where you save the pieces.

Hope you enjoy the play, cheers!
